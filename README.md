```SEB``` is the easiest and most secure way to track outgoing emails. We were advised by our peers to implement API key verification for the purpose of preventing bad actors from taking advantage of it so this feature will be our next update.
<br/>

## Use Case
As cyber security enthusiasts, we have come to understand over 95% of cyber crimes are due to human error, and over 90% of these crimes are carried out through email. Our goal was to create a tool that allowed users to track data-sensitive emails or outgoing files with as many data points as possible. This data includes but is not limited to

```
- IP Address
- Date and Time
- Country
- City
- Timezone
```


## Installation

Use the package manager npm to install the following packages

```bash
npm install express
npm install express-ip
npm install sqlite3
```

## Usage
Setup Personal Server <br/> <br/>
This project will be a working UI within the next few weeks but in the meantime, the tool can be used with the following commands. To follow our progress please follow our repo: https://github.com/cszach/email-beacon-frontend
```JavaScript
// Host the node application on a web server, on port 3000
node main.js
```

```curl
// Generate hash to insert into an email
curl --insecure -H "Content-type: application/json" 'http://127.0.0.1:3000/generateHash'
```

```
// Periodically send get requests to the following URL to get the mail status
curl --insecure -H "Content-type: application/json" 'http://127.0.0.1:3000/emailBeaconStatus?hash=<YOUR_GENERATED_HASH>'
```

Or use our API <br/> 

```curl
// Generate hash to insert into an email or share
curl --insecure -H "Content-type: application/json" 'http://198.199.120.178/generateUUID'
```

```curl
// Check the status of a generated tracking link
curl --insecure -H "Content-type: application/json" 'http://198.199.120.178/EmailBeaconStatus?UUID=UUUDHERE'
```
